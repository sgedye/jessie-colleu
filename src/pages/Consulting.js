        <p className={styles.mainText}>By using my extensive experience in literacy, teacher development and leadership, I help school leaders and teachers develop coherent literacy strategies with maximum impact. I also provide ongoing advice and guidance to schools in order to help solve specific learning or teaching issues, to maximise progress, and to connect educators with a broader professional community.</p>
        <p className={styles.mainText}>I can work with individuals and teams for a day or with multiple visits over the space of several months.</p>
        <p className={styles.mainText}><a href="https://jessie-colleu.netlify.app/contact">Get in touch</a> if you want to request either a consulting session, a training workshop for your school or a more personalised 1:1 coaching conversation. The intended outcome in the coaching process is that you, as educator, understands and realises the answers are within yourself- it just takes a practiced soundboard or reflective partner to help find them.</p>

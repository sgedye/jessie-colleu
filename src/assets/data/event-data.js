        The first researchED Perth, Western Australia in October 2020. This
        event provides an exciting opportunity for teachers, researchers and
        academics to get together to discuss ways in which education in
        Australia can use evidence to drive better teaching and learning.
        <br />
        <br />
        Sessions are designed for anyone interested in finding out what evidence
        tells us about education, of any level, beginner or expert.There will be
        sessions on literacy, cognitive psychology, best teaching practice,
        language and learning, mental health, and many more.
        <br />
        <br />
        The conference will be opened by the Director General of Education in
        Western Australia, Lisa Rodgers.

        The online UNITE SPLD Conference seeks to bring together researchers,
        parents, teachers and practitioners working with children with Specific
        Learning Differences (SpLD) and special educational needs.
        <br />
        <br />
        This conference will showcase research that covers aspects of behaviour,
        identification, early intervention, technology, multilingualism,
        assessment and much more for children and adults with special learning
        needs. Research and practical solutions will be presented in short,
        engaging and entertaining sessions accompanied by poster presentations.
        And what’s most exciting – there are several opportunities to talk
        directly with researchers who are making a difference internationally.

        33 of the country’s accomplished teachers and school leaders converged in Sydney to discuss the best ways to make their students and schools future ready. Each Fellow is a recipient of a prestigious <a href="https://teachingawards.com.au/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Commonwealth Bank Teaching Award</a>, and together, provide a breadth and depth of teaching and school leadership experience and expertise in a range of Australian school settings.  Many of these schools are in communities where complexities and challenges of low socioeconomic disadvantage exist.<br /><br />

        ResearchED returns to Australia with another day of evidence, discussion, challenge, networking and provocation. Education is in a period of huge upheaval, as the evidence revolution continues. Old ways of working are now being scrutinised, criticised, updated and improved, and we’ve started to see dynamic and exciting new ways of teacher-led involvement of rebooting the classroom.<br /><br />

        Alongside 11 other leading educators from throughout Australia, I was fortunate to embark on a week-long study tour of Singapore in July. The tour was part of a 12-month Fellowship awarded to me through the annual Commonwealth Bank Teaching Awards, an initiative run in partnership with education charity Schools Plus.<br /><br />
        During the tour we visited a number of leading education institutes and schools, including the National Institute of Education, Ngee Ann Secondary School, the Academy of Singapore Teachers, Nan Chiau Primary School, the Academy of Principals Singapore, and Crest Secondary School.<br /><br />
        The Commonwealth Bank Teaching Awards are run in partnership with Schools Plus, a not-for-profit organisation, which was established in 2013 to increase philanthropy for schools that most need support. Launched in 2016, the awards are run annually to recognise and reward 12 teachers across Australia with a $45,000 Teaching Fellowship including a Study Exchange Tour to Singapore. The majority of the recipients are teachers or school leaders working in schools in disadvantaged communities.
